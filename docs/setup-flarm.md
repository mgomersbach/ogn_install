# ADS-B and FLARM

Small document targeted for gliders to get up and running with ADS-B and FLARM.
I'll also create a script to do these things.

## What

Get Raspberry Pi up and running with Raspbian as Operating System, RTL-SDR dongle as signal receiver and OGN, FR24 and FlightAware as output (The latter two giving you entprise/pro account for their services)

## How

Many dongles and Operating Systems will work, these are recommended for a quick setup.

- Buy Raspberry Pi: https://www.amazon.de/s?k=raspberry+pi
- Buy RTL-SDR Dongle (and antenna): https://www.amazon.de/s?k=rtl+sdr+r820t2
- Download OS: https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/NOOBS_latest
- Install OS: https://thepi.io/how-to-install-noobs-on-the-raspberry-pi/
- Install Dongle:
  - Blacklist DVB-T modules
